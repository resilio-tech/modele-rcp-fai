# Model for assessing the environmental impacts of Internet Service Provision (ISP) following the ISP PCR

## Introduction 
At the beginning of 2023, ADEME published the methodological standard for the environmental assessment for Internet Service Provision (ISP). The document is available in French and English in the [ADEME website](https://librairie.ademe.fr/produire-autrement/6008-principes-generaux-pour-l-affichage-environnemental-des-produits-de-grande-consommation.html).

This repository contains the model for the collective action related to the evaluation of the environmental impacts of Internet Service Provider in France. It follows the methodology described in detail in the ISP Product Category Rule (PCR).

Indeed, from January 1st 2024, the AGEC law imposes a regulatory obligation for operators to communicate to their subscribers the gCO2/kByte ratio specific to their networks based on the common methodology provided by ADEME.
